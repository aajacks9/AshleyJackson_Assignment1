/* I need to first have a function that determines prime number
    then I need to have a function that stops finding prime numbers after the 1000th
 */

/* prime number function*/

I need a counter that only counts the prime numbers
I also need a function that deterimes if a number is prime or not
I also need a function that stops the counter after it reaches the 1000th prime number
so i need to go through each number determine if it is prime, if so then add it to the count
then start the function again until the count is 1000
then display that final number that was counted
